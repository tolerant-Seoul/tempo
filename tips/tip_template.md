# TIP-XXXX: TIP Title

## Abstract

Short 2–4 sentence high level summary

## Motivation

Explain what problem this solves/functionality this introduces, and any alternatives considered (if applicable). Add context or links to other specs/resources that serve as prerequisites to this spec.

## Assumptions

List the explicit assumptions this spec depends on (for example: upstream invariants, trust boundaries, deployment ordering, and backward compatibility expectations). Call out what happens if an assumption is violated.

## Threat Model

List the actors this spec relies on and, for each, describe the trust assumptions in one or two lines. Include any trust boundaries, permissions, or adversarial behaviors that are in or out of scope.

# Specification


This section should provide a complete description of the feature’s behavior and required interfaces.

If the feature introduces a precompile, this section should include the full interface definition along with comprehensive NatSpec. Each function should clearly describe its parameters, return values, and error conditions. The goal is to define the intended functionality clearly enough that an engineer can implement the reference contract, test suite, and node implementation without needing to infer any implementation details.

For features that do not introduce a precompile, this section should define the exact mechanics of the feature/system. Describe the relevant state transitions, data structures, encodings, etc. When the feature interacts with existing components, explain how they relate and how data moves between them each system component.

Where a feature involves multiple processes, state diagrams / flowcharts should be considered when helpful.

# Observability

Describe the events needed to monitor and debug this TIP in production. List each event that MUST be emitted, its fields, and the operational question it answers. If no new events are required, write `N/A` and explain why existing observability is sufficient.

# Invariants

This section should describe invariants that must always hold, and outline the critical cases that the test suite must cover.
